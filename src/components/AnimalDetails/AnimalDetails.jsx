/*
Using URL Route Params for a Detail View
A common pattern in web applications is to see a listing view with many things to choose from (like a list of movies). When clicking on one of them, we want to load up all of the details for that item, often in a new component and usually getting more information from the database, too.

You can store these details in Redux, but this is not ideal. We're storing more than needed in Redux just in case a user picks that item. Typically there are way more details in the database we want. Plus, Redux is lost upon a refresh.
